### Description
## Overview of assignment
This assignement was to take prewritten code and refactor it to fit HTML5 syntax. The story behind the assignment was based around a full-service marketing company requiring refactored code to improve accesability.  Essentially I took all "div class="example" and made each one the relevant syntax element (e.g. header, main, aside, etc.).  Following changing the HTML to the proper syntax, I had to then change the CSS to mirror the new elements and not just a bunch of classes.  The final step was then to condense the redundant CSS code from similar elements into one block.  Throughout every step I added relevant comments and structual formatting to make the code more legible.
